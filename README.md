# scotec Software Solutions AB

Today, the development of new applications is hardly conceivable without open source software. The use of ready-made software components reduces development time and lowers costs.

We also rely on open source in our development and would like to give something back to the community. We have therefore decided to publish reusable code from our projects.

Our libraries are constantly updated and improved. The individual components are initially tailored to the use-cases in our projects. Suggestions for improvements or extensions are welcome.

Feel free to visit us on our [website](https://www.scotec-software.com).
